# Workflow: Lite SDLC

Lightweight workflow for scripts and utilities. No gates, no gospel.

## Requirements
1. **README.md** — Purpose, usage, examples, dependencies
2. **Tests** — For complex logic only (not required for simple scripts)
3. **Conventional commits** — feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.

## Quality Bar
- Runs successfully on target platform
- Has clear documentation
- Has error handling for external dependencies
- Handles common edge cases

## That's It
No gates. No gospel. No governance theater. No sprint planning.
Write good code, document it, ship it.
