# Workflow: Research

Exploration and research workflow. No deadlines, no deliverables.

## Process
1. Define question or area of exploration
2. Research: read, search, experiment, analyze
3. Capture findings in FINDINGS.md or NOTES.md
4. Push interesting discoveries to AAKT
5. Link sources and references

## Output Format (FINDINGS.md)
```markdown
# [Research Topic]

## Question
What are we trying to understand?

## Findings
- Finding 1 (source: [link])
- Finding 2 (source: [link])

## Open Questions
- What remains unclear?

## Implications
- How does this affect other projects?
```

## AAKT Integration
Push to AAKT with tags: `["research", "<topic>", "<project-name>"]`
Cross-project research is valuable — tag broadly.

## No Pressure
Commits optional. Notes are the output, not code. Take your time.
