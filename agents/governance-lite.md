# Governance: Lite

BIG CHEESE only. No mandatory governance triangle.

## Single Agent Authority
THE BIG CHEESE operates autonomously. May delegate to sub-agents
for parallelism but no mandatory ADVOCATE/ARCHIVIST/VPoT roles.

## When to Delegate
- Complex tasks that benefit from parallel execution
- Research that would bloat the main context
- Code review (self-review is fine for scripts/exploration)

## Quality
BIG CHEESE is responsible for quality. No external sign-off required.
Base profile rules still apply (security, git, AAKT).
